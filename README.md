Face detection using Haarcascades is a machine learning based approach where cascade functions are trained with set of input data.OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face ,eyes , smile etc.but here attached 2 classifiers only for face and smile .you can this same program for all other classifiers as well.
