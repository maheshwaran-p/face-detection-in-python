# Face Detection using OpenCV


make sure you have opencv installed.you can install it using pip.
   pip install opencv-python(windows)
   pip3 install opencv-python(ubuntu).

Face detection using Haarcascades is a machine learning based approach where cascade functions are trained with set of input data.OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face ,eyes , smile etc.but here i enclosed  2 classifiers only for face and smile .you can use this same program for all other classifiers as well by changing haarcascade file name . can  give input through webcam (video) as well file input(image) both programes are available here, to  detect the face.
